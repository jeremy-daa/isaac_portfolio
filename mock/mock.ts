  aboutme_para1:
    "From my home in the vibrant streets of Addis Ababa, I craft intricate narratives of struggle, resilience, and identity, treating my music as a medium for unfiltered truth. My work is an exploration of the human condition, where sharp-edged spoken word and complex lyricism cut through soulful, atmospheric beats. I donâ€™t just make songs; I aim to build worlds with my words, inviting listeners into a space of profound honesty and raw emotion.",
  aboutme_para2:
    "I'm driven by a passion to give a voice to the misunderstood, and my music is my testament to the power of turning pain into poetry. I navigate the complexities of life with a bold perspective, transforming my personal trials into anthems of survival and ambition. This philosophy is the heart of my latest album, Art Prisoner. To listen is to understand my journey, and I invite anyone seeking authenticity in sound and story to join me.",
